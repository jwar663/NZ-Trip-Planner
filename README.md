# README
## Group-23-Azure-Ant's RoadTrip Planner Web Application
This project leverages the power of many APIs to display helpful information when planning a road trip. The app allows the user to navigate between locations, view, add and remove nearby places or restaurants, as well as viewing relevant weather information. The user can save and load their trips.
### Motivation
There are many apps that allow the ability to navigate within cities and find nearby places. The functionality to scale this to throughout different cities and generally create a road trip has not been widely adopted. This application will help bridge the gap between city transit and full inter-city road trips.
### Features
* Navigation To and From places using google maps API
* Considering different nearby places and restaurants using google places API
* Save future planned trips with google drive
* Load planned trips with google drive
* View weather information regarding destinations using weather API
* Sign in with OAuth2.0
